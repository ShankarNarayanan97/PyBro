<h2> Who is it for? </h2>
<h4> Anyone who wants to develop a standard browser using just Python and Pyqt5 </h4>

<h2> Where can I use it? </h2>
<h4> You can use this browser in systems having minimal memory footprint like Raspberry Pi , Orange Pi, Banana Pi or any other ARM devices. In fact you can use it anywhere if you can install Python.</h4>

<h2> Sounds interesting, what browser is it based on ? </h2>
<h4> It's built using Chromium, specifically version 56 and has V8 engine for Javascript rendering and Blink for the browser engine due to which it has 28 % faster reload behaviour with reduced bandwidth and the rendering capailities improved by 35% as compared to its predecessors </h4>

<h2> How should I run it in my computer ? </h2>
<h5>1. Install Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> </h5>
<h5>2. Install any Python IDE of your choice <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments">here</a> </h5>
